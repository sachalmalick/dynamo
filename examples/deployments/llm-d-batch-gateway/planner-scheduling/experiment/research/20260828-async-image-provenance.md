# llm-d Async image provenance

## Binary identity

The deployed container used a private POC registry. Its coordinates and image
digest are intentionally omitted from checked-in artifacts. The live observer
reported that the pod `imageID` matched the local build output, but neither
identity is retained here. The checked-in corpus therefore cannot independently
verify the deployed binary or bind it to the dirty source tree.

## Local BuildKit record

- Build reference: `lucidno9yuu3kule43czt2y66`
- Context: `.`
- Dockerfile: `Dockerfile`
- Platform: `linux/amd64`
- VCS repository: `https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-async.git`
- VCS base revision: `877a068f9e22f6062c291ed36b2f8d14aa663a85`
- Started: 2026-08-28 09:20:36 America/New_York
- Duration: 1 minute 23 seconds
- Private-registry output identities: omitted from checked-in POC artifacts

## Source reconstruction

The August 28 checkout had the recorded base revision and was the best
available reconstruction of the Go implementation used for that build.
Historical reconstruction identifiers captured then are:

- Tracked worktree diff captured near build time:
  `36bfa4b96aa0897cfb748eacedb03cef6b3cae12a08efb8298093c560f48abc9`
- Tracked Go-only binary diff captured from the August 28 checkout:
  `26d06d9cda1a2cf27a9faeb7c42355e190e71bb6e3e12551206af92b2b12d423`
- `api/dispatch_control.go`:
  `e0d07938ca2d93ac6f50cb999b6f9ce5c6e8a01accda3118ba22e1c8bd5b898c`
- `api/dispatch_control_test.go`:
  `8ed45a14b7391392da12dadf5705d50f209741c8eee5ad2c7b5281807e5a513c`
- `pkg/redis/leased_rate_gate.go`:
  `621ece42935bf5ff67e495fe53d4b044d27dd1ae9cb76d43b8fdc591e0fc27ac`
- `pkg/redis/leased_rate_gate_test.go`:
  `dafc487e893cb2d9c21c7982bdb42139e3b8e905911183f46b562a92435f1f18`

The binary reports `version=dev`, `commit=unknown`, and `buildDate=unknown`.
Therefore the reconstruction above is strong local provenance but is not
cryptographically bound to the binary. A production image should embed the
source revision and a clean-tree or patch identity during the build.

## Validation tied to this implementation

At the time of the historical run, the focused Go packages for API, pipeline,
flow control, worker, metrics, pub/sub, Redis, and server all passed. The tagged
Redis pool-gate integration test, `go vet`, Helm lint, and chart rendering also
passed. The canonical live run then dispatched exactly 100 attempts and
completed all 100 successfully on the observed pod. These are historical notes,
not a current-head rerun or a cryptographic image-provenance claim.
